  I implemented a bigram character-level language model, which I will later develop into a modern Transformer language model, like GPT. In this process, I focused on (1) learning torch.Tensor and its efficient use in neural network evaluation, and (2) the overall framework of language modeling, including model training, sampling, and loss evaluation, such as negative log likelihood for classification.
